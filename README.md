# Mist: Materials Information for Simulation and Theory
Mist is a Python tool for storing, sharing, and using information about materials in models and simulations. It seeks to reduce the barriers for workflows involving multiple modeling tools -- either for interchangeable tools (e.g. multiple AM thermal simulation codes) or for sequential model evaluations (e.g. AM thermal simulation -> analytic microstructure prediction -> strength prediction).

## Installing Mist
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/mist
$ cd mist
$ pip install .
```
